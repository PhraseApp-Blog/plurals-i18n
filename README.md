# Plural i18n demo project

This demo is a companion to a Phrase tutorial about plural localization.

This branch shows the ICU MessageFormat plural syntax.

## How to run the demo

1. Clone the repository.
2. (Optional) Install dependencies with `npm install`.

   - This is mainly if you want to update the Tailwind CSS styles.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (you don't need a web server, just open the file directly).
