# Plural i18n demo project

This demo is a companion to a Phrase tutorial about plural localization.

- The `main` branch shows plural formatting using vanilla i18next.
- The `icu` branch shows plural formatting using i18next with ICU support.

## How to run the demo

1. Clone the repository.
2. (Optional) Install dependencies with `npm install`.

   - This is mainly if you want to update the Tailwind CSS styles.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (you don't need a web server, just open the file directly).
